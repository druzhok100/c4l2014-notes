## kicking off projects

  - To kick off a project, hold a meeting with your stakeholders and your developers. 
  - Use "5 whys" to do discovery and find the root of the problem you're trying to solve
  - Define goals first
    - SMART: 
    specific: who, what, when, where, why
    measurable: can be time-based
    attainable: realistic given current resources. Other A's: assignable
    relevant
    time-bound 
  - from goals comes scope
