## kicking off projects

  - To kick off a project, hold a meeting with your stakeholders and your developers. 
  - Use "5 whys" to do discovery and find the root of the problem you're trying to solve
  - Define goals first
    - SMART: 
    specific: who, what, when, where, why
    measurable: can be time-based
    attainable: realistic given current resources. Other A's: assignable
    relevant
    time-bound 
  - from goals comes scope

## stakeholders

 - [stakeholder analysis worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hu_xmNzAZMfOzwPv41an3eu1IJJKAxD68WA8d6K63kg/edit?pli=1)

 - understand the personalities
 - types of stakeholders: executive sponsor, sponsor, project manager, team members, other affected groups

## project charters

 - [Project one-pager by Tito Sierra](http://www.slideshare.net/tsierra/the-projectonepager)
 - [Example one-pager from Rosie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BrZzT9dHE0r9slJFJo9Jmc91rZJ3Kl0aBHrBcz4RlyE/edit?usp=drive_web)

Establish the project, set the boundaries. 

 - Objective
 - Outcomes: enumerated outcomes that must be achieved (SMART goals)
 - Out of scope
 - Team
 - Schedule (ish)

## breaking down work/assigning responsibility

- [Task breakdown worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14z3k-EJc9rbEgzrOPjmkS8T4PbSz3rXMjTxUAm8o2FQ/edit?pli=1)
- [Example breakdown](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EmHnmrYfyszQI1sSr3Bn196FKFe9SMuNx76c0wgEplo/edit?pli=1)

Take your high-level buckets (SMART goals) and break them down into tasks. If you're doing agile, you hand goals over as user stories and developers break those down into tasks.

**Revisit tasks** regularly to make sure they're still realistic. Does the task breakdown need to be modified?

## time estimates

Often libraries don't think about project cost. We should. Estimating time helps you estimate cost.

**Track your time** to be able to estimate your time. Rosy uses an app called [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/).

**Know your audience.** Some team members will give you one estimate...know how they work and adjust estimates accordingly.

**Estimate discrete tasks based on the Fibonacci sequence.** Will a task take 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 hours?

### buffers

Choose a realistic buffer B and apply the percentage to an entire project's time T.

  T / (1 - B%)
