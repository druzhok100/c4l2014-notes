# day 3 keynote: an interview with valerie aurora

One of the first women coders in Linux. [valerieaurora.org](http://blog.valerieaurora.org/)

The ["Fractal" view of gender binary](http://geekfeminism.org/2010/01/09/quick-hit-the-gender-binary-fractal-in-geekdom/) - in cultures we have occupations that are "male" and "female".

If we afforded greater status to writing we'd have better documentation.

Sometimes the best way to influence a group is to leave and join/influence a competing organization.

[Impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome): someday people are going to find me out. Better work really hard and keep my work a secret.

Caretaker status: spread out work like lunch planning, cleaning, etc., which is typically "women's" work. Value this work more and make men step up to work on this too.

So often we tell the oppressed group to make the culture better which is yet another way to oppress them!

### status in libraries

What about class and status within librarianship? How can we get more women in systems positions (or is that the answer)? Need to do things like raise status of jobs women already do.

### privilege

How can we use our privilege for good? Men, white people, people in power...

- Listen. Don't talk.
- Improve the diversity of the info you take in, including the people you follow on twitter!
- Notice when you feel discomfort or guilt. It's a sign you are learning something.
- Look it up and learn! Research your guilt.
- Use your status to defer opportunities for folks (i.e. interview requests)
- Think about whose voice you are amplifying (i.e. Anil Dash [only retweeting women for a year](https://medium.com/the-web-we-make/79403a7eade1))
- Look at the work of people like [Shanley Kane](https://medium.com/tech-culture-briefs/3570e446ec3c)

#### "mansplaining"/"Scandisplaining"

Some people are used to having their opinions heard and respected...even when their opinions are uninformed.

Remind people of your expertise.

### language

Be aware of words like "shrill", "hysterical", "bossy"...think about adjectives used solely to describe women. Often used in tone arguments, when people say an argument wasn't said right.

Naming things: default open:

- "Software creator" instead of "programmer"
- "all-gender" bathrooms instead of "gender neutral"
- Not using "men and women" to mean "all people".
