# day 1 - breakout - ux in organizational culture

Coral facilitates. Her question for the group is, how can we overcome the focus on library experience and focus instead on user experience?

## what's your problem?

Introductions. Common problems:

 - "Just make a web page!"
 - "I can figure this weird arcane and overly complicated thing out. Why can't anyone else?"
 - Convincing stakeholders that design isn't print design, doesn't need to be the same for everyone and isn't static.
 - Redesign by committee, have mercy!
 - Getting ready for a redesign
 - Publishing/learning about UX research. Who's going through IRB, who's publishing this stuff?
 - Devaluation of UX work in library, funding or mandate
 - UX not being built into organizational policies etc.
 - How can we scale up UX above and beyond one-project research? Expanding to include more projects beyond the website?
 - How can we convince our organizations to not recreate the org chart with the website?
 - Trying to create a UX position that is beyond web librarian
 - Not just testing sites with librarians (!)
 - What about user experience for back-of-house software?
 - I'm a web team of one. Help?
 - "Put the MARC view back in the catalog!"
 - Do we really need to default to advanced search? Battling the exceptions vs the average user?
 - Taking a guerrilla approach to UX research
 - Not a lot of staff in digital area
 - Moving from a culture of complaint to a culture of...fixing

A couple folks here working in organizations that have UX and assessment built into the culture. Thanks in advance for your knowledge, y'all!
